# **Glossary**

- Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) Streaming: A technology that adjusts video quality in
  real-time based on a viewer's network conditions and device capabilities. It
  works by encoding the video into multiple versions at different bitrates,
  allowing the player to switch between them to prevent buffering.

- AV1 (AOMedia Video 1): An open-source and royalty-free video compression
  format developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia). It is designed to
  surpass the compression efficiency of its predecessors, including H.264,
  H.265, and VP9.

- Bj√∏ntegaard Delta (BD-Rate): A method used to compare the compression
  efficiency of two video codecs by calculating the average percentage of
  bitrate savings one offers over the other for the same objective quality.

- Codec: Short for "encoder/decoder," a codec is a technical standard that
  defines the methods for compressing and decompressing digital video data.

- Content Delivery Network (CDN): A network of servers distributed
  geographically that cache content closer to users, enabling faster and more
  reliable delivery of video streams.

- H.264/AVC (Advanced Video Coding): A widely adopted, royalty-bearing video
  compression standard that has been the dominant codec for internet video for
  many years.

- H.265/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding): The royalty-bearing successor to
  H.264/AVC, designed to offer approximately 50% better compression efficiency,
  especially for high-resolution video like 4K and 8K.

- H.266/VVC (Versatile Video Coding): The successor to H.265/HEVC, which aims to
  reduce the bitrate by another 50% for the same perceptual quality.

- HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS): The technology that enables adaptive bitrate
  streaming over standard HTTP web servers. Common implementations include
  MPEG-DASH and Apple's HLS.

- Mean Opinion Score (MOS): Considered the most accurate way to measure
  perceived video quality, this metric is based on subjective ratings collected
  from human observers.

- Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): A traditional metric for measuring the
  quality of a compressed video by calculating the ratio between the maximum
  possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise. It is known to
  correlate poorly with human perception of quality.

- Quality of Experience (QoE): A measure of a viewer's overall satisfaction with
  a video streaming service, encompassing factors like visual quality, startup
  time, and buffering events.

- Rate-Distortion (RD) Curve: A graph used to evaluate an encoder's performance
  by plotting the video quality (distortion) against the file size (rate) across
  various encoding settings.

- Structural Similarity Index (SSIM): A video quality metric designed to better
  align with human perception than PSNR by measuring the degradation of
  structural information in an image.

- SVT-AV1 (Scalable Video Technology for AV1): An open-source software encoder
  for the AV1 codec, designed for production environments with a focus on
  providing a good trade-off between performance and compression efficiency.

- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): A financial model used in the paper to estimate
  the total cost of a video asset, which includes the costs of transcoding,
  storage, and delivery.

- Transcoding: The process of converting a video file from one format to
  another, often to create multiple bitrate versions for adaptive streaming.

- Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF): A perceptual video quality metric
  developed by Netflix that uses machine learning to combine several quality
  metrics into a single score that more accurately reflects human perception.

- VP9: A royalty-free video codec developed by Google as a competitor to
  H.265/HEVC and the predecessor to AV1.

- x264: A widely used open-source software implementation of the H.264/AVC
  standard.

- x265: A popular open-source software implementation of the H.265/HEVC
  standard.
